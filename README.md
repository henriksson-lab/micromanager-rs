# micromanager-rs

A pure-Rust translation of [MicroManager](https://micro-manager.org/) (`mmCoreAndDevices`).

The port is based on https://github.com/micro-manager/mmCoreAndDevices, hash 67fe60267bc8d95554369d7fa42912775588e538

* 2026-06-20: Work on bringing full parity in progress


## This is an LLM-mediated faithful (hopefully) translation, not the original code!

Most users should probably first see if the existing original code works for them, unless they have reason otherwise. The original source
may have newer features and it has had more love in terms of fixing bugs. In fact, we aim to replicate bugs if they are present, for the
sake of reproducibility! (but then we might have added a few more in the process)

There are however cases when you might prefer this Rust version. We generally agree with [this page](https://rewrites.bio/)
but more specifically:
* We have had many issues with ensuring that our software works using existing containers (Docker, PodMan, Singularity). One size does not fit all and it eats our resources trying to keep up with every way of delivering software
* Common package managers do not work well. It was great when we had a few Linux distributions with stable procedures, but now there are just too many ecosystems (Homebrew, Conda). Conda has an NP-complete resolver which does not scale. Homebrew is only so-stable. And our dependencies in Python still break. These can no longer be considered professional serious options. Meanwhile, Cargo enables multiple versions of packages to be available, even within the same program(!)
* The future is the web. We deploy software in the web browser, and until now that has meant Javascript. This is a language where even the == operator is broken. Typescript is one step up, but a game changer is the ability to compile Rust code into webassembly, enabling performance and sharing of code with the backend. Translating code to Rust enables new ways of deployment and running code in the browser has especial benefits for science - researchers do not have deep pockets to run servers, so pushing compute to the user enables deployment that otherwise would be impossible
* Old CLI-based utilities are bad for the environment(!). A large amount of compute resources are spent creating and communicating via small files, which we can bypass by using code as libraries. Even better, we can avoid frequent reloading of databases by hoisting this stage, with up to 100x speedups in some cases. Less compute means faster compute and less electricity wasted
* LLM-mediated translations may actually be safer to use than the original code. This article shows that [running the same code on different operating systems can give somewhat different answers](https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.3820). This is a gap that Rust+Cargo can reduce. Typesafe interfaces also reduce coding mistakes and error handling, as opposed to typical command-line scripting

But:

* **This approach should still be considered experimental**. The LLM technology is immature and has sharp corners. But there are opportunities to reap, and the genie is not going back to the bottle. This translation is as much aimed to learn how to improve the technology and get feedback on the results.
* Translations are not endorsed by the original authors unless otherwise noted. **Do not send bug reports to the original developers**. Use our Github issues page instead.
* **Do not trust the benchmarks on this page**. They are used to help evaluate the translation. If you want improved performance, you generally have to use this code as a library, and use the additional tricks it offers. We generally accept performance losses in order to reduce our dependency issues
* **Check the original Github pages for information about the package**. This README is kept sparse on purpose. It is not meant to be the primary source of information


## Structure

```
claude-micromanager/
├── mm-device/          # Trait definitions (replaces MMDevice/)
├── mm-core/            # Engine: device manager, config, circular buffer (replaces MMCore/)
└── adapters/           # Hardware adapters, one crate per device family
```

### `mm-device`

Defines the core abstractions:

- **Traits** — `Device`, `Camera`, `Stage`, `XYStage`, `Shutter`, `StateDevice`, `VolumetricPump`, `Hub`, and more
- **`PropertyMap`** — typed property storage with allowed-value constraints
- **`Transport`** — serial communication abstraction (`send_recv`, `send_bytes`, `receive_bytes`) + `MockTransport` for unit tests
- **Error types**, **`PropertyValue`**, **`DeviceType`**, **`FocusDirection`**

## Demo

`mm-demo` is a live-preview app that uses `CMMCore` with the simulated `DemoCamera`. It opens a window and continuously snaps frames at ~30 fps.

```sh
cargo run -p mm-demo
```

The demo shows the minimal setup needed to drive a camera through the Rust API:

```rust
let mut core = CMMCore::new();
core.register_adapter(Box::new(DemoAdapter));
core.load_device("Camera", "demo", "DCamera").unwrap();
core.initialize_device("Camera").unwrap();
core.set_camera_device("Camera").unwrap();
core.set_exposure(25.0).unwrap();

core.snap_image().unwrap();
let frame = core.get_image().unwrap();
// frame.data is &[u8] (GRAY8), frame.width / frame.height are pixel dimensions
```

The window renders GRAY8 pixels as RGB and closes on Esc.

### `mm-core`

The `CMMCore` engine:

- **`DeviceManager`** — load/unload/dispatch to typed device handles
- **`AdapterRegistry`** — static registration via the `inventory` crate
- **`CircularBuffer`** — fixed-size ring buffer for image sequence acquisition
- **`Config`** / config-file load/save

### Adapters

W = Windows, M = macOS, L = Linux. SDK-wrapped adapters are feature-gated; all others are pure serial with no vendor dependencies.

#### Native SDK / System Dependencies

Open-source Linux packages:

- Aravis: `sudo apt-get install libaravis-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev` (`aravis-0.8.pc` and its libusb pkg-config dependency for `--features aravis`).
- IIDC/libdc1394: `sudo apt-get install libdc1394-dev pkg-config` (`libdc1394-2.pc` for `--features iidc`).
- OpenCV: `sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev pkg-config clang libclang-dev` (`opencv4.pc` or `OpenCVConfig.cmake` for `--features opencv`).

Vendor SDKs:

- Andor SDK3: set `ANDOR_SDK3_ROOT`; Linux expects `include/`, `lib/libatcore.so`, and `lib/libatutility.so`. Use `ANDOR_SDK3_STUB=1` only for compile-only tests without hardware.
- Basler Pylon: install Pylon from Basler's pylon downloads page (https://www.baslerweb.com/de-de/downloads/software/?downloadCategory.values.label.data=pylon) and set `PYLON_ROOT` if not under `/opt/pylon`. The current `pylon-cxx` wrapper targets Pylon 5/6 layouts; newer Pylon installs may require wrapper updates.
- Daheng Galaxy: install Galaxy SDK and set `DAHENG_SDK_ROOT` or `GALAXY_ROOT`, or otherwise make `libgxiapi.so` visible to the linker/runtime loader. Linux installs use `lib/<arch>/libgxiapi.so` and need that same directory in `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` at runtime for `liblog4cplus_gx.so`; `DAHENG_LIB_DIR` can point directly at that directory for unpacked SDK validation. Use `DAHENG_STUB=1` only for compile-only tests without hardware.
- FLIR Scientific Camera SDK / Spinnaker: FLIR's Science Camera SDK at https://www.flir.com/en-eu/products/flir-science-camera-sdk/ is a paid/commercial SDK path. For reproducible open-source builds, users are advised not to buy hardware that depends on this paid SDK path.
- JAI eBUS: install the JAI eBUS SDK from JAI's support software pages and set `EBUS_SDK_ROOT` to the platform root containing `include/` and `lib/` or `Includes/` and `Libraries/`. The Ubuntu 22.04 x86_64 JAI package unpacks under `/opt/jai/ebus_sdk/Ubuntu-22.04-x86_64`. The underlying Pleora eBUS SDK from https://www.pleora.com/ may require paid access; for reproducible open-source builds, users are advised not to buy hardware that depends on this paid SDK path.
- PVCAM/PICAM: download PVCAM from Teledyne Vision Solutions' software and firmware downloads page. Set `PVCAM_ROOT` to `/opt/pvcam` for a normal Linux install; the build looks for `sdk/include/master.h`, `sdk/include/pvcam.h`, and `library/<arch>/libpvcam.so`. For an unpacked SDK/runtime pair, set `PVCAM_ROOT` to the extracted SDK `opt/pvcam` and `PVCAM_LIB_DIR` to the extracted runtime `opt/pvcam/library/<arch>`. Use `PVCAM_STUB=1` only for compile-only tests without hardware.
- Thorlabs TSI: set `TSI_SDK_ROOT` or Thorlabs' `THORLABS_TSI_SDK_PATH_64_BIT` / `THORLABS_TSI_SDK_PATH_32_BIT`; the root must contain `tl_camera_sdk.h` and `libtl_camera_sdk.*`. Use `TSI_STUB=1` only for compile-only tests without hardware.

## Building

```sh
cargo build --workspace
```

## Testing

```sh
cargo test --workspace
```

All adapters have unit tests that run against a `MockTransport` — no hardware required.

## Adding an Adapter

1. Create `adapters/mm-adapter-<name>/` with a `Cargo.toml` depending on `mm-device`.
2. Implement `Device` (and the appropriate device-type trait) for your struct.
3. Embed a `PropertyMap` and `Option<Box<dyn Transport>>`.
4. Add the crate to the workspace `Cargo.toml`.
5. Write tests using `MockTransport`.

Minimal example (`Cargo.toml`):

```toml
[package]
name = "mm-adapter-mydevice"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
mm-device = { path = "../../mm-device" }
```

Minimal struct pattern:

```rust
use mm_device::{error::MmResult, property::PropertyMap, traits::Device,
                transport::Transport, types::{DeviceType, PropertyValue}};

pub struct MyDevice {
    props: PropertyMap,
    transport: Option<Box<dyn Transport>>,
}

impl MyDevice {
    pub fn new() -> Self { /* define properties */ todo!() }
    pub fn with_transport(mut self, t: Box<dyn Transport>) -> Self {
        self.transport = Some(t); self
    }
}

impl Device for MyDevice {
    fn name(&self) -> &str { "MyDevice" }
    fn description(&self) -> &str { "My serial device" }
    fn initialize(&mut self) -> MmResult<()> { todo!() }
    fn shutdown(&mut self) -> MmResult<()> { Ok(()) }
    fn get_property(&self, name: &str) -> MmResult<PropertyValue> { self.props.get(name).cloned() }
    fn set_property(&mut self, name: &str, val: PropertyValue) -> MmResult<()> { self.props.set(name, val) }
    fn property_names(&self) -> Vec<String> { self.props.property_names().to_vec() }
    fn has_property(&self, name: &str) -> bool { self.props.has_property(name) }
    fn is_property_read_only(&self, name: &str) -> bool { false }
    fn device_type(&self) -> DeviceType { DeviceType::Generic }
    fn busy(&self) -> bool { false }
}
```
